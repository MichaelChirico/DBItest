\value{
\code{dbGetStream()} always returns an object coercible to a \link{data.frame}
with as many rows as records were fetched and as many
columns as fields in the result set,
even if the result is a single value
or has one
or zero rows.

\section{Failure modes}{

An error is raised when issuing a query over a closed
or invalid connection,
if the syntax of the query is invalid,
or if the query is not a non-\code{NA} string.
The object returned by \code{dbGetStream()} can also be passed to
\code{\link[arrow:as_record_batch_reader]{arrow::as_record_batch_reader()}} to create an Arrow
RecordBatchReader object that can be used to read the result set
in batches.
The chunk size is implementation-specific.
