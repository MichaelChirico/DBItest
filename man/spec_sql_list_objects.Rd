\value{
\code{dbListObjects()}
returns a data frame
with columns
\code{table} and \code{is_prefix} (in that order),
optionally with other columns with a dot (\code{.}) prefix.
The \code{table} column is of type list.
Each object in this list is suitable for use as argument in \code{\link[=dbQuoteIdentifier]{dbQuoteIdentifier()}}.
The \code{is_prefix} column is a logical.
This data frame contains one row for each object (schema, table
and view)
accessible from the prefix (if passed) or from the global namespace
(if prefix is omitted).
Tables added with \code{\link[=dbWriteTable]{dbWriteTable()}}
are part of the data frame,
including temporary objects if supported by the database.
As soon a table is removed from the database,
it is also removed from the data frame of database objects.

The returned names are suitable for quoting with \code{dbQuoteIdentifier()}.
An error is raised when calling this method for a closed
or invalid connection.

\section{Specification}{

The result of quoting can be passed to \code{\link[=dbUnquoteIdentifier]{dbUnquoteIdentifier()}}.
The unquoted results are equal to the \code{table} object.
(For backends it may be convenient to use the \link{Id} class, but this is
not required.)
indicating if the \code{table} value in this row can be passed as the
\code{prefix} argument to another call to \code{dbListObjects()}.
For a call with the default \code{prefix = NULL}, the \code{table}
values that have \code{is_prefix == FALSE} correspond to the tables
returned from \code{\link[=dbListTables]{dbListTables()}}.

TBD: Enumeration of schemas.
}

\section{Additional arguments}{

TBD: \code{temporary = NA}

This must be provided as named argument.
See the "Specification" section for details on their usage.
