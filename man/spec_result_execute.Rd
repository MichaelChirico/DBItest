\section{Additional arguments}{

The following arguments are not part of the \code{dbExecute()} generic
(to improve compatibility across backends)
but are part of the DBI specification:
\itemize{
\item \code{params} (default: \code{NULL})
\item \code{immediate} (default: \code{FALSE})
}

They must be provided as named arguments.
See the "Specification" sections for details on their usage.
}

\section{Specification}{


The \code{param} argument allows passing query parameters, see \code{\link[=dbBind]{dbBind()}} for details.

The \code{immediate} argument supports distinguishing between "direct"
and "prepared" APIs offered by many database drivers.
Passing \code{immediate = TRUE} leads to immediate execution of the
statement, via the "direct" API (if supported by the driver).
