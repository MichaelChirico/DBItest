\description{
The \pkg{DBI} package defines the generic DataBase Interface for R.
The connection to individual DBMS is made by packages that import \pkg{DBI}
(so-called \emph{DBI backends}).
This document formalizes the behavior expected by the functions declared in
\pkg{DBI} and implemented by the individal backends.

To ensure maximal portability and exchangeability, and to reduce the effort
for implementing a new DBI backend, the \pkg{DBItest} package defines
a comprehensive set of test cases that test conformance to the DBI
specification.
In fact, this document is derived from comments in the test definitions of
the \pkg{DBItest} package.
This ensures that an extension or update to the tests will be reflected in
this document.

\section{Getting started}{

A DBI backend is an R package,
which should import the \pkg{DBI}
and \pkg{methods}
packages.
For better or worse, the names of many existing backends start with
\code{R}, e.g., \pkg{RSQLite}, \pkg{RMySQL}, \pkg{RSQLServer}; it is up
to the package author to adopt this convention or not.
}

\section{Driver}{

Each DBI backend implements a "driver" class,
which must be an S4 class and inherit from the \code{DBIDriver} class.
SQL Data types exist for all basic R data types. dbDataType() does not
throw an error and returns a nonempty atomic character
Package exports constructor function that has no arguments.
  The name of the constructor can be tweaked via \code{constructor_name}
  in the context's \code{\link{tweaks}}, default: package name without
  the leading R.
  This test is optional, the
  \code{constructor} test is a slightly weaker version.
Package exports constructor function, all arguments have default values.
  The name of the constructor can be tweaked via \code{constructor_name}
  in the context's \code{\link{tweaks}}, default: package name without
  the leading R (if it exists).
Return value of dbGetInfo has necessary elements
Repeated load, instantiation, and unload of package in a new R session.
