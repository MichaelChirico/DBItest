\description{
The \pkg{DBI} package defines the generic DataBase Interface for R.
The connection to individual DBMS is made by packages that import \pkg{DBI}
(so-called \emph{DBI backends}).
This document formalizes the behavior expected by the functions declared in
\pkg{DBI} and implemented by the individal backends.

To ensure maximal portability and exchangeability, and to reduce the effort
for implementing a new DBI backend, the \pkg{DBItest} package defines
a comprehensive set of test cases that test conformance to the DBI
specification.
In fact, this document is derived from comments in the test definitions of
the \pkg{DBItest} package.
This ensures that an extension or update to the tests will be reflected in
this document.
}
\section{Getting started}{

A DBI backend is an R package,
which should import the \pkg{DBI}
and \pkg{methods}
packages.
For better or worse, the names of many existing backends start with
\code{R}, e.g., \pkg{RSQLite}, \pkg{RMySQL}, \pkg{RSQLServer}; it is up
to the package author to adopt this convention or not.
