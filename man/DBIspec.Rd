\description{
The \pkg{DBI} package defines the generic DataBase Interface for R.
The connection to individual DBMS is made by packages that import \pkg{DBI}
(so-called \emph{DBI backends}).
This document formalizes the behavior expected by the functions declared in
\pkg{DBI} and implemented by the individal backends.

To ensure maximum portability and exchangeability, and to reduce the effort
for implementing a new DBI backend, the \pkg{DBItest} package defines
a comprehensive set of test cases that test conformance to the DBI
specification.
In fact, this document is derived from comments in the test definitions of
the \pkg{DBItest} package.
This ensures that an extension or update to the tests will be reflected in
this document.
}
\section{Getting started}{

A DBI backend is an R package,
which should import the \pkg{DBI}
and \pkg{methods}
packages.
For better or worse, the names of many existing backends start with
\sQuote{R}, e.g., \pkg{RSQLite}, \pkg{RMySQL}, \pkg{RSQLServer}; it is up
to the package author to adopt this convention or not.
}

\section{DBI classes and methods}{

A backend defines three classes,
which are subclasses of
\linkS4class{DBIDriver},
\linkS4class{DBIConnection},
and \linkS4class{DBIResult}.
The backend provides implementation for all methods defined for these
base classes, but not provided by DBI.
All methods have an ellipsis \code{...} in their formals.
}

\section{Construction of the \code{DBIDriver} object}{

The backend must support creation of an instance of its \linkS4class{DBIDriver}
subclass
with a \dfn{constructor function}.
By default, its name is the package name without the leading \sQuote{R}
(if it exists), e.g., \code{SQLite} for the \pkg{RSQLite} package.
For the automated tests, the constructor name can be tweaked using the
\code{constructor_name} tweak.

The constructor must be exported, and
it must be a function
that is callable without arguments.
For the automated tests, unless the
\code{constructor_relax_args} tweak is set to \code{TRUE},
an empty argument list is expected.
Otherwise, an argument list where all arguments have default values
is also accepted.
