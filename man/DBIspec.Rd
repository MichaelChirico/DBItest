\description{
The \pkg{DBI} package defines the generic DataBase Interface for R.
The connection to individual DBMS is made by packages that import \pkg{DBI}
(so-called \emph{DBI backends}).
This document formalizes the behavior expected by the functions declared in
\pkg{DBI} and implemented by the individal backends.

To ensure maximal portability and exchangeability, and to reduce the effort
for implementing a new DBI backend, the \pkg{DBItest} package defines
a comprehensive set of test cases that test conformance to the DBI
specification.
In fact, this document is derived from comments in the test definitions of
the \pkg{DBItest} package.
This ensures that an extension or update to the tests will be reflected in
this document.

\section{Getting started}{

This function defines the following tests:
\describe{
\item{\code{has_context}}{
\code{make_context()} must be called before calling any of the
\code{test_} functions in this package}
\item{\code{package_dependencies}}{
Can relate the driver to an installed (or devtools-loaded) package;
package depends (!) on "DBI" and imports "methods"}. This test requires
the \code{devtools} package and will be skipped if it is not installed.
\item{\code{package_name}}{
Optional: Package name starts with R.
}
