\description{
The \pkg{DBI} package defines the generic DataBase Interface for R.
The connection to individual DBMS is made by packages that import \pkg{DBI}
(so-called \emph{DBI backends}).
This document formalizes the behavior expected by the functions declared in
\pkg{DBI} and implemented by the individal backends.

To ensure maximum portability and exchangeability, and to reduce the effort
for implementing a new DBI backend, the \pkg{DBItest} package defines
a comprehensive set of test cases that test conformance to the DBI
specification.
In fact, this document is derived from comments in the test definitions of
the \pkg{DBItest} package.
This ensures that an extension or update to the tests will be reflected in
this document.
}
\section{Getting started}{

A DBI backend is an R package,
which should import the \pkg{DBI}
and \pkg{methods}
packages.
For better or worse, the names of many existing backends start with
\sQuote{R}, e.g., \pkg{RSQLite}, \pkg{RMySQL}, \pkg{RSQLServer}; it is up
to the package author to adopt this convention or not.
}

\section{Driver}{

\subsection{Construction}{
The backend must support creation of an instance of this driver class
with a \dfn{constructor function}.
By default, its name is the package name without the leading \sQuote{R}
(if it exists), e.g., \code{SQLite} for the \pkg{RSQLite} package.
For the automated tests, the constructor name can be tweaked using the
\code{constructor_name} tweak.

The constructor must be exported, and
it must be a function
that is callable without arguments.
For the automated tests, unless the
\code{constructor_relax_args} tweak is set to \code{TRUE},
an empty argument list is expected.
Otherwise, an argument list where all arguments have default values
is also accepted.

}


Each DBI backend implements a \dfn{driver class},
which must be an S4 class and inherit from the \code{DBIDriver} class.
This section describes the construction of, and the methods defined for,
this driver class.
}

\section{Parametrized queries and statements}{

\pkg{DBI} supports parametrized (or prepared) queries and statements
via the \code{\link[DBI:dbBind]{DBI::dbBind()}} generic.
Parametrized queries are different from normal queries
in that they allow an arbitrary number of placeholders,
which are later substituted by actual values.
Parametrized queries (and statements) serve two purposes:
\itemize{
\item The same query can be executed more than once with different values.
The DBMS may cache intermediate information for the query,
such as the execution plan,
and execute it faster.
\item Separation of query syntax and parameters protects against SQL injection.
}

The placeholder format is currently not specified by \pkg{DBI};
in the future, a uniform placeholder syntax may be supported.
Consult the backend documentation for the supported formats.
For automated testing, backend authors specify the placeholder syntax with
the \code{placeholder_pattern} tweak.
Known examples are:
\itemize{
\item \code{?} (positional matching in order of appearance) in \pkg{RMySQL} and \pkg{RSQLite}
\item \code{$1} (positional matching by index) in \pkg{RPostgres} and \pkg{RSQLite}
\item \code{:name} and \code{$name} (named matching) in \pkg{RSQLite}
}

\pkg{DBI} clients execute parametrized statements as follows:
\enumerate{
\item Call \code{\link[DBI:dbSendQuery]{DBI::dbSendQuery()}} or \code{\link[DBI:dbSendStatement]{DBI::dbSendStatement()}} with a query or statement
that contains placeholders,
store the returned \code{\linkS4class{DBIResult}} object in a variable.
Mixing placeholders (in particular, named and unnamed ones) is not
recommended.
It is good practice to register a call to \code{\link[DBI:dbClearResult]{DBI::dbClearResult()}} via
\code{\link[=on.exit]{on.exit()}} right after calling \code{dbSendQuery()}, see the last
enumeration item.
\item Construct a list with parameters
that specify actual values for the placeholders.
The list must be named or unnamed,
depending on the kind of placeholders used.
Named values are matched to named parameters, unnamed values
are matched by position.
All elements in this list must have the same lengths and contain values
supported by the backend; a \code{\link[=data.frame]{data.frame()}} is internally stored as such
a list.
The parameter list is passed a call to \code{\link[=dbBind]{dbBind()}} on the \code{DBIResult}
object.
\item Retrieve the data or the number of affected rows from the  \code{DBIResult} object.
\itemize{
\item For queries issued by \code{dbSendQuery()},
call \code{\link[DBI:dbFetch]{DBI::dbFetch()}}.
\item For statements issued by \code{dbSendStatements()},
call \code{\link[DBI:dbGetRowsAffected]{DBI::dbGetRowsAffected()}}.
(Execution begins immediately after the \code{dbBind()} call,
the statement is processed entirely before the function returns.
Calls to \code{dbFetch()} are ignored.)
}
\item Repeat 2. and 3. as necessary.
\item Close the result set via \code{\link[DBI:dbClearResult]{DBI::dbClearResult()}}.
}
}

\section{Transactions}{

\subsection{\code{dbBegin("DBIConnection")} and \code{dbCommit("DBIConnection")}}{
Transactions are available in DBI, but actual support may vary between backends.
A transaction is initiated by a call to \code{\link[DBI:dbBegin]{DBI::dbBegin()}}
and committed by a call to \code{\link[DBI:dbCommit]{DBI::dbCommit()}}.
Both generics expect an object of class \code{\linkS4class{DBIConnection}}
and return \code{TRUE} (invisibly) upon success.

The implementations are expected to raise an error in case of failure,
but this is difficult to test in an automated way.
In any way, both generics should throw an error with a closed connection.
In addition, a call to \code{\link[DBI:dbCommit]{DBI::dbCommit()}} without
a call to \code{\link[DBI:dbBegin]{DBI::dbBegin()}} should raise an error.
Nested transactions are not supported by DBI,
an attempt to call \code{\link[DBI:dbBegin]{DBI::dbBegin()}} twice
should yield an error.

Data written in a transaction must persist after the transaction is committed.
For example, a table that is missing when the transaction is started
but is created
and populated during the transaction
must exist and contain the data added there
both during
and after the transaction.

The behavior is not specified if other arguments are passed to these
functions. In particular, \pkg{RSQLite} issues named transactions
if the \code{name} argument is set.

The transaction isolation level is not specified by DBI.

}
}

\section{Specification}{

The backend can override the \code{\link[DBI:dbDataType]{DBI::dbDataType()}} generic
for its driver class.

This generic expects an arbitrary object as second argument.
To query the values returned by the default implementation,
run \code{example(dbDataType, package = "DBI")}.
If the backend needs to override this generic,
it must accept all basic R data types as its second argument, namely
\link{logical},
\link{integer},
\link{numeric},
\link{character},
dates (see \link{Dates}),
date-time (see \link{DateTimeClasses}),
and \link{difftime}.
It also must accept lists of \link{raw} vectors
and map them to the BLOB (binary large object) data type,
unless the \code{omit_blob_tests} tweak is set to \code{TRUE}.
As-is objects (i.e., wrapped by \code{\link[=I]{I()}}) must be
supported and return the same results as their unwrapped counterparts.
The SQL data type for \link{factor}
and \link{ordered} is the same as for character.
The behavior for other object types is not specified.


All data types returned by \code{dbDataType()} are usable in an SQL statement
of the form
\code{"CREATE TABLE test (a ...)"}.


DBI specifies only the return type for \code{dbConnect()}.


A warning is issued when releasing a connection without calling
\code{dbDisconnect()},
or when calling \code{dbDisconnect()} on an already disconnected connection.


No warnings occur under normal conditions.
The DBIResult object returned by \code{dbSendQuery()} must be valid, i.e.,
\code{\link[=dbIsValid]{dbIsValid()}} returns \code{TRUE}.
When done, the DBIResult object must be cleared with a call to
\code{\link[DBI:dbClearResult]{DBI::dbClearResult()}}.
Failure to clear the result set leads to a warning
when the connection is closed.

If the backend supports only one open result set per connection,
issuing a second query invalidates an already open result set
and raises a warning.
The newly opened result set is valid
and must be cleared with \code{dbClearResult()}.


Fetching multi-row queries with one
or more columns be default returns the entire result.
Multi-row queries can also be fetched progressively
by passing a whole number (\link{integer}
or \link{numeric})
as the \code{n} argument.
A value of \link{Inf} for the \code{n} argument is supported
and also returns the full result.
If more rows than available are fetched, the result is returned in full
without warning.
If zero rows are fetched, the columns of the data frame are still fully
typed.
Fetching fewer rows than available is permitted,
no warning is issued when clearing the result set.


The column types of the returned data frame depend on the data returned:
\itemize{
\item \link{integer} for integer values between -2^31 and 2^31 - 1
\item \link{numeric} for numbers with a fractional component
\item \link{logical} for Boolean values (some backends may return an integer)
\item \link{character} for text
\item lists of \link{raw} for blobs
\item coercible using \code{\link[=as.Date]{as.Date()}} for dates
(also applies to the return value of the SQL function \code{current_date})
\item coercible using \code{\link[hms:as.hms]{hms::as.hms()}} for times
(also applies to the return value of the SQL function \code{current_time})
\item coercible using \code{\link[=as.POSIXct]{as.POSIXct()}} for timestamps
(also applies to the return value of the SQL function \code{current_timestamp})
\item \link{NA} for SQL \code{NULL} values
}

If dates and timestamps are supported by the backend, the following R types are
used:
\itemize{
\item \link{Date} for dates
(also applies to the return value of the SQL function \code{current_date})
\item \link{POSIXct} for timestamps
(also applies to the return value of the SQL function \code{current_timestamp})
}

R has no built-in type with lossless support for the full range of 64-bit
or larger integers. Here, the following rules apply:
\itemize{
\item Values are returned as numeric
\item Conversion to character always returns a lossless decimal representation
of the data
}


\code{dbClearResult()} frees all resources associated with retrieving
the result of a query or update operation.
The DBI backend can expect a call to \code{dbClearResult()} for each
\code{\link[DBI:dbSendQuery]{DBI::dbSendQuery()}} or \code{\link[DBI:dbSendStatement]{DBI::dbSendStatement()}} call.


Fetching multi-row queries with one
or more columns be default returns the entire result.
A value of \link{Inf} for the \code{n} argument is supported
and also returns the full result.
If more rows than available are fetched, the result is returned in full
without warning.
If zero rows are fetched, the columns of the data frame are still fully
typed.
Fetching fewer rows than available is permitted,
no warning is issued.


No warnings occur under normal conditions.
The DBIResult object returned by \code{dbSendStatement()} must be valid, i.e.,
\code{\link[=dbIsValid]{dbIsValid()}} returns \code{TRUE}.
When done, the DBIResult object must be cleared with a call to
\code{\link[DBI:dbClearResult]{DBI::dbClearResult()}}.
Failure to clear the result set leads to a warning
when the connection is closed.
If the backend supports only one open result set per connection,
issuing a second query invalidates an already open result set
and raises a warning.
The newly opened result set is valid
and must be cleared with \code{dbClearResult()}.


No warnings occur under normal conditions.


The returned expression can be used in a \code{SELECT ...} query,
and for any scalar character \code{x} the value of
\code{dbGetQuery(paste0("SELECT ", dbQuoteString(x)))[[1]]}
must be identical to \code{x},
even if \code{x} contains
spaces,
quotes (single
or double),
backticks,
or newlines
(in any combination)
or is itself the result of a \code{dbQuoteString()} call coerced back to
character (even repeatedly).
If \code{x} is \code{NA}, the result must merely satisfy \code{\link[=is.na]{is.na()}}.
The strings \code{"NA"} or \code{"NULL"} are not treated specially.

\code{NA} should be translated to an unquoted SQL \code{NULL},
so that the query \code{SELECT * FROM (SELECT 1) a WHERE ... IS NULL}
returns one row.


Calling \code{\link[DBI:dbGetQuery]{DBI::dbGetQuery()}} for a query of the format \code{SELECT 1 AS ...}
returns a data frame with the identifier, unquoted, as column name.
Quoted identifiers can be used as table and column names in SQL queries,
in particular in queries like \code{SELECT 1 AS ...}
and \code{SELECT * FROM (SELECT 1) ...}.
This is also true for column names that are empty strings
or contain special characters such as a space,
a dot,
a comma,
or quotes used to mark strings
or identifiers,
if the database supports this.
In any case, checking the validity of the identifier
should be performed only when executing a query,
and not by \code{dbQuoteIdentifier()}.


Fetching multi-row queries with one
or more columns be default returns the entire result.
Multi-row queries can also be fetched progressively
by passing a whole number (\link{integer}
or \link{numeric})
as the \code{n} argument.
A value of \link{Inf} for the \code{n} argument is supported
and also returns the full result.
If more rows than available are fetched, the result is returned in full
without warning.
If zero rows are fetched, the columns of the data frame are still fully
typed.
Fetching fewer rows than available is permitted,
no warning is issued when clearing the result set.
