\value{
\code{dbSendStatement()} returns
an S4 object that inherits from \linkS4class{DBIResult}.
The result set can be used with \code{\link[=dbGetRowsAffected]{dbGetRowsAffected()}} to
determine the number of rows affected by the query.
Once you have finished using a result, make sure to clear it
with \code{\link[=dbClearResult]{dbClearResult()}}.
An error is raised when issuing a statement over a closed
or invalid connection,
or if the statement is not a non-\code{NA} string.
An error is also raised if the syntax of the query is invalid
and all query parameters are given (by passing the \code{params} argument)
or the \code{immediate} argument is set to \code{TRUE}.

\section{Specification}{

No warnings occur under normal conditions.
When done, the DBIResult object must be cleared with a call to
\code{\link[=dbClearResult]{dbClearResult()}}.
Failure to clear the result set leads to a warning
when the connection is closed.
If the backend supports only one open result set per connection,
issuing a second query invalidates an already open result set
and raises a warning.
The newly opened result set is valid
and must be cleared with \code{dbClearResult()}.



The \code{param} argument allows passing query parameters, see \code{\link[=dbBind]{dbBind()}} for details.

The \code{immediate} argument supports distinguishing between "direct"
and "prepared" APIs offered by many database drivers.
Passing \code{immediate = TRUE} leads to immediate execution of the
statement, via the "direct" API (if supported by the driver),
and not wait for parameters to be bound.
}

\section{Additional arguments}{

The following arguments are not part of the \code{dbSendStatement()} generic
(to improve compatibility across backends)
but are part of the DBI specification:
\itemize{
\item \code{params} (default: \code{NULL})
\item \code{immediate} (default: \code{FALSE})
}

They must be provided as named arguments.
See the "Specification" sections for details on their usage.
